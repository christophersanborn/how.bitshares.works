Securing BitShares with Ledger Nano
***********************************

Your BitShares account can be secured by a `Ledger Nano S hardware wallet <https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s>`_.  Hardware wallets secure crypto assets by protecting private keys. Transaction signing occurs on the hardware device itself, rather than on a host computer, isolating keys from exposure to malware or other threats.
